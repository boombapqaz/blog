<p>
    a twenty something from aus on the spectrum. i made this website to have *something* remotely
    representative of me on the internet. i make music, write pretentiously and generally struggle to have a cohesive sense of
     self while being crippled with nostalgia (often for things i never even experienced). i'm also into fighting games, rpgs,
      anime, photography, audio technology, fashion and sociology, especially in the digital form. anyway enjoy!
