<p><b>we are coming to you fucking live!!!! our reporters are in the field!!!</b></p>
<p>a series of updates, short musings on the state of the website, the world and the self.</p>
<p><b>5.1.25</b></p>
<p>i'm struggling to finalise a concept, and i realise i've been avoiding updating the blog until it's done, so fuck it. redesign is postponed indefinately.</p>
<p><b>11.12.24</b></p>
<p>updated a few small things. a redesign is in thw works for the new year...</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>patch 18.11.24</b></p>
<p>added some cool links, swapped some links around, made a section of favourite things</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>12.11.24</b></p>
<p>this is in a state i feel it's presentable. need to fill our some content tho. i look back at the reddit post with great shame, not because i feel any better about reddit, but its obvious i was just throwing shit out there</p>

<p><b>11.11.24</b></p>
<p>i've made the most barebones prototype. no css. no nothing. well, i changed the fonts, put a fav in and changed how images behave but eh.
    looking minimal. anyway, the place is functioning. yay.
