<p><b>we are coming to you fucking live!!!! our reporters are in the field!!!</b></p>
<p>a series of updates, short musings on the state of the website, the world and the self.</p>
<p><b>10.3.25</b></p>
<p>in the wake of yesterdays post, i want to move away a bit from posts spanning socio-political contexts and just into more personal stuff. part of my resistance is i don't consider myself so fundamnetally interesting that i need to broadcast myself to the world, part of it is i don't really know what the fuck i should talk about, but hey. i wanna give it a crack.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>9.3.25</b></p>
<p>took me a minute, got awfully busy part way, but the politics blog is done. a post-script is on the way, plus some other posts. leave suggestions for what else i can do in the guestbook!!</p>

<p><b>6.02.225</b></p>
<p>what an eventful january!! big life changes. in the process of writing a massive blog on politics. decided to take my lettrboxd seriously, so i've been going hard on that</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>5.1.25</b></p>
<p>i'm struggling to finalise a concept, and i realise i've been avoiding updating the blog until it's done, so fuck it. redesign is postponed indefinately.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p><b>12.11.24</b></p>
<p>this is in a state i feel it's presentable. need to fill our some content tho. i look back at the reddit post with great shame, not because i feel any better about reddit, but its obvious i was just throwing shit out there</p>

<p><b>11.11.24</b></p>
<p>i've made the most barebones prototype. no css. no nothing. well, i changed the fonts, put a fav in and changed how images behave but eh.
    looking minimal. anyway, the place is functioning. yay.
