<p><b>we are coming to you fucking live!!!! our reporters are in the field!!!</b></p>
<p>a series of updates, short musings on the state of the website, the world and the self.</p>
<p><b>10.5.25 - 2</b></p>
<p>false alarm. uuupah swooped in like a mother pulling a tolder with a fork away from the powerpoint. back to our regular scheduled programming</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>10.5.25</b></p>
<p>rss feed is temporarily offline while i get some help integrating the xml passthrough from vsc. sorry!!!</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>4.5.25</b></p>
<p>added some links, writing a few different posts! making sure they're up to standards. as you were, soldiers.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>20.4.25</b></p>
<p>i've implemented an rss feed. the usual method of parsing the xml file through github hasn't worked so i had to put it through neocities directly. i think im going to be sick</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>13.4.25</b></p>
<p>aight so the reddit blog is wiped. i wasn't massively proud of it but neocities might've caught onto the fact it graced some controversial subject matter cause the link wouldn't work either way. i've also fixed some spelling mistakes and updated my favourites.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>11.4.25</b></p>
<p>another post! it seems a lot of my friends don't know this blog exists. sadness.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>1.4.25</b></p>
<p>idiosyncratic is such a delightful word. the vowels and consonants work in perfect tandem to create a series of sounds that roll gracefully off the tongue. used incorrectly it sticks out like a sore thumb. applied appropriately however, it takes on the most refulgent affect. </p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>10.3.25</b></p>
<p>in the wake of yesterdays post, i want to move away a bit from posts spanning socio-political contexts and just into more personal stuff. part of my resistance is i don't consider myself so fundamnetally interesting that i need to broadcast myself to the world, part of it is i don't really know what the fuck i should talk about, but hey. i wanna give it a crack.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>9.3.25</b></p>
<p>took me a minute, got awfully busy part way, but the politics blog is done. a post-script is on the way, plus some other posts. leave suggestions for what else i can do in the guestbook!!</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>6.02.225</b></p>
<p>what an eventful january!! big life changes. in the process of writing a massive blog on politics. decided to take my lettrboxd seriously, so i've been going hard on that</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>5.1.25</b></p>
<p>i'm struggling to finalise a concept, and i realise i've been avoiding updating the blog until it's done, so fuck it. redesign is postponed indefinately.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>11.12.24</b></p>
<p>updated a few small things. a redesign is in thw works for the new year...</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>patch 18.11.24</b></p>
<p>added some cool links, swapped some links around, made a section of favourite things</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>12.11.24</b></p>
<p>this is in a state i feel it's presentable. need to fill our some content tho. i look back at the reddit post with great shame, not because i feel any better about reddit, but its obvious i was just throwing shit out there</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>11.11.24</b></p>
<p>i've made the most barebones prototype. no css. no nothing. well, i changed the fonts, put a fav in and changed how images behave but eh.
    looking minimal. anyway, the place is functioning. yay.
