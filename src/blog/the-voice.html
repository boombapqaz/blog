title: the voice

<p>so. the voice. man. what the fuck could one start.</p>

<p>if i was to break down the demographic of the 'no' vote, i'd say 1/3 were genuine, no bars held, no shame racists. 
    people who genuinely just didn't want indigenous people to have rights. i don't have anything super profound to add to this 
    statement. fucking white people man. homie at work once said he has a hatred for about 70% of the white race over their 
    ignorance for the plights of poc, and at the risk of sounding extremist, damn he kinda right tho (he is also white).
</p>

<p>the next 3/6s were people working off misinformation, often sewn by the first third mentioned, but to totally alleviate blame, 
    to say that this wasn't racially motivated in any capacity would be at best disingenuous. the fact the liberal party sent out texts 
    openly telling people to vote no if they udt didn't know is so wild to me. like those conspiracy theory fucks always lead with the 
    idea there's something the government isn't telling us, and that the labor and greens were scheming to brainwash the population, as 
    if their party of choice didn't literally advocate for suppression of voter knowledge and sheep mentality. you know, that thing 
    that all good democracies run on. my partner and her family got a few books on the voice to atleast see the arguments on both sides. 
    i had the great displeasure of 'reading' some 'arguments' for the no campaign, and to no suprise, all of the evidence was either 
    half researched, where statistics were mentioned, but the socio-economic causes were disregarded and a narrative spun, or completely 
    anecdotal. one chapter in particular was written by a greek immigrant comparing his experience as a reason that 'anybody can make 
    it as is'. i shouldn't need to explain how utterly insane that mental gymnastics routine is. i could critique the book at length, 
    let me just say, the yes book? published by harper collins. the no book? some private firm i have never come across browsing academia.
</p>

<p>jacinta price for example has made her stance be one of neoliberalism, that aboriginal people didn't need a 'voice' because 
    it would create unequal footing, that indigenous people would magically gain 2 votes in the elections and some shit. and if that 
    was true, yeah i'd argue that's reason to vote no, but that was not at all in the brief included. her stance at large we're all 
    technically on the same footing, so wellfare, community programs and other aid to aboriginal peoples is giving them a free pass and 
    an unfair advantage against the white folk or whatever.
</p>


<p>now, imagine you were lining up for a marathon, you're prepped, youve put on your lynx africa, chalk on your hands, idk what 
    athletes do bro. and your opponent pulls out the glock and shoots your fucking kneecap. the ref, not at all concerned with the 
    unregistered firearm, goes 'woah woah woah guys we don't do that here'. everyone line up again.' and then you have to run a race 
    with a fucked leg. yes, everyone now is again in roughly equal positions, but you're now only able to limp over while bradley 
    smith over there is fucking killing it. that's what racial inequality and generational trauma is like. no matter how equal the 
    footing may be, the damage is already done and will continue to affect the communities. 
</p>


<p>the last sixth, and the audience i have unrelenting frustrations for, are (at the risk of a generalisation) white liberals, 
    those who voted no because 'its not enough'. now, if anyone was to ask why in some cases i'm moderate in some of my left ideals, 
    i'd probably coin a term 'toxic idealism', the oppositional stances that people take when the functional solutions aren't 'enough'. 
    the argument the voice wasn't enough is particularly frustrating because yes, it wasn't enough. we're literally a colony built on 
    the blood of first nations people. a prison state. factually, the statement is true. a committee to adress over a thousand years of 
    racism would never be enough. the solution however, was not to vote no. a vote no aligns you with dangerous people, and they're 
    voting no because it furthers the dangerous goals they have in place. i'm baffled that anyone claiming to be for indigenous rights 
    could comfortably sit and say 'our plan to adress racism is to agree with pauline hanson's verdict and vote no so that in future a 
    better deal will magically come up.' like that doesn't set a precedent. because now, whenever that referendum comes up, a new scheme 
    whatever the fuck, the argument will always be 'well we asked last time and the people said no, so they've already spoken, this is 
    too radical, you liberal fucks.'. the argument that feels painfully weak to make is 'this is the best that's on the table right now' 
    but it unfortunately rings true. toxic idealism on the left has been a recurring issue surrounding changes in policy. it's something 
    that the greens are unfortunately notorious for, sometimes unfairly, but that stereotype came from somewhere.
</p>

<p>
    there's long been a culture of white liberals overiding issues surrounding communities of colour. key distinction, it's perfectly 
    fine to campaign, express opinions and stand with poc. there's this mentality that white people aren't 'allowed to have an opinion'. 
    that's bullshit. the support of white people, or the otherwise majority is an invaluable asset, both statistically and socially. 
    when i say 'white liberal' i'm referring to the subsection of white progressives who, in the process of pearl clutching, genuine 
    virtue signalling and sometimes even white guilt (another incredibly cringe approach to race relations) drown out the voices of 
    poc, lgbtqi, the disabled and other vulnerable people. while ultimately well meaning, they, to use bo burnham's description 'view 
    every socio-political conflict through the myopic lense of their own self-actualisation'. these are the motherfuckers who saw the 
    ads of some indigenous people saying to vote no immediately bought their word for it in fear of being racist despite the 83% approval 
    rate and the fact those ads were overwhelmingly orchestrated by white people using poc as props.
</p>

<p>sigh. i fucking hate white liberals. stop trying to be fucking martyrs.</p>


<p>as for now, the important thing is to not lose hope. i know that's a tough ask coming from someone who can't speak think the 
    mental anguish to indigenous australians. it's the times where hope seems the most dire that we need it the most. please be kind to
    one another.

    always was and always will be.
