<p><b>How can I tell what model I have?</b></p>

<p>On the bottom of your PSP should be a barcode that ends in PSPxxxx. The basic model is the closest thousand (eg 3002 is a 3000 model). The last number in those 4 digits 
    is the specific revision, which usually boils down to minor build differences for internal components.</p>

<p><b>Help! I can't connect my PSP to my wifi!</b></p>

<p>
By modding your PSP it should be compatible with WPA2! But check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0E9kyxa1k&t=69s">here</a> to set up your modem.

<p><b>How do I convert a CHD file to an iso?</b></p>

<p>Download <a href="https://onionui.github.io/docs/advanced/chdman">CHDMAN</a>, put your CHD files in a folder with it, and create a blank text document. Put this in it.</p>

<pre><code>
    for %%i in (*.chd) do (
chdman extractcd -i "%%i" -o "%%~ni.cue" -ob "%%~ni.iso"
del "%%~ni.cue"
)
</code></pre>

<p>Save the text file as a .bat file and double click on it.</p>

<p><b>How do I sort and organise my games?</b></p>

<p>Use <a href="https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/PspHBSortTool">this</a></p>

<p><b>How do you know which PS1 games are unofficial? Are they okay to play?</b></p>

<p>Ps1 games that were officially released for the psn will give off a grey background with a black text box. Unofficial ones usually have custom art or just the cover art on 
    a black background. You can play these, but they're not optimised, and any games that need to use L2 or R2 won't have a corresponding set of shoulder buttons on the PSP.</p>

<p><b>I want to go down the path of repairs and mods - what tools do you recommend?</b></p>

<p>A small screwdriver kit that has at least Phillips, flathead and torque (T3 - T5) if possible. A silicon mat with screw holder, and a soldering iron, preferably a station 
    if you can. Make sure it’s temperature controlled as a bare minimum. I'd recommend using a small conical tip, 1mm or below. Consider also investing into some flux, 
    desolder braid (or wick), and an autoranging multimeter to test continuity and voltages.</p>

<p><b>Will you do other console modding guides?</b></p>

<p>Very most likely not. I've got into PS2 modding too, but that's a much more open-ended endeavour with many different models, region differences and desired experiences, 
    and the methods to achieve the same functionality vary wildly based on those factors.</p>

<p><b>What about Nintendo consoles?</b></p>

<p>Please don't talk to me ever. I'd rather kill myself - save uuupah, everyone I know who likes Nintendo enough to mod their consoles is fucking insufferable. I'm not like 
    the other nerds, I'm a cool nerd. Nintendo is bafflingly overrated.</p>

<br>
<p>OKAY some of their games absolutely fuck. Zelda is great. I'm yet to play a bad Mario game. The switch has some great indie titles and I mash up dem bloodclat Wii Sports 
    bowling pins. But the hyperfan culture around Nintendo and the hypocritical justification of predatory practices is fucking insane. No, you probably shouldn't go into 
    debt to buy a switch 2 on launch. I guess what I mean to say is - Kirby Air Ride will make a man out of you and Yoshi is unquestionably transfemme coded, fuck you. And 
    mean-spirited theatrics aside I truly love everyone and what makes them happy, but Nintendo just isn't that thing for me. Sorry.</p>
