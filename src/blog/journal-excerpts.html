<p>i have an oustandingly long google doc i use as a journal. here's some vaguely hopecore messages from that to lead you into 2025 wether you want time to move forward or not. find all the quotations from media and i shall personally award you nothing</p>
<p>i'm breathing</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>fuck em up, or go down trying.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>always, i'll care</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>this anger is a cycle, and I have the power to stop</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>if love is the answer, we'll hold on.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>wherever you are, i'm sending you love. thank you.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>wholesome supervillain arc</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>love, not spite. take care of yourself.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>chasing the sun that i can't see but i know it's there</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>just vibe how you are, love how you love and life will go according to plan.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>through immense and vast darkness there still can be the slither of hope</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>“she gave a smile that looked a little bit sad; and the thought that i had such a beautiful person in my life once crossed my mind."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>the cycle ends here. we must be better than this.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>there is forgiveness in this world</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>something something laundry and taxes ect ect</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>i will show kindness, grace, wisdom, humility and talent the likes my bloodline has never known</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>everything, in time</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>I think,</p>
<p>the most important thing in this world</p>
<p>is to love</p>
<p>and be loved</p>
<p>which is simple</p>
<p>yet incredibly hard</p>
<p>how does one know love?</p>
<p>truly?</p>
<p>and that's okay</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>i refuse to let the ugliness around me desecrate the beauty within me.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>“i want a job i don't hate!” i declare</p>
<p>“i want to see friends and go for 5am runs and feel my life is in fact lived!” i cry</p>
<p>“i want to make music and have a functioning website, something, anything creative to show that i am capable of even the slightest level of beauty and accurate self expression!” i proclaim.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>I WILL LIVE FOR MYSELF.</p>
<p>I WILL CARVE MY LIFE INTO STONE.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>end transmission</b></p>
