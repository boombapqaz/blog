title: "politics: the left"

<p>a bit of pretext to this blog. you might read this and think i’m a spineless coward. fair. 
    instead of thinking this is how you should approach everyone, think of this as how to approach those you can 
    tell are politically disengaged, maybe those already learning left but with some caveats, or those you can identify 
    as single-issue voters. undeniably, there are those who cannot and should not appeal to. you are not going to want 
    to approach those who profit off bigotry, those who knowingly post misinformation, or people who are too far gone 
    (yes, they unfortunately exist). take this all with a pinch of salt, and feel free to pick and choose what you find helpful. 
    enjoy, i guess.</p>
    
<p>the first thing i want to flag is, i get it. i, and many people reading this, aren't from usa. i don't actually care though. 
    i am the strongest proponent that the changes we are seeing in the world are not, and will not be, isolated. i understand the
     need to say 'we don't live in america, it doesn't matter'. it's both an invitation to stop the conversation, stop thinking 
     about it and ultimately, not have to reckon with the very real consequences that on some level we feel hopeless about.</p>

<p>next, and of more contention, the incessant use of ‘left’ and ‘right’. i too think this simplification of politics is 
    incredibly reductive. shit man, even the four-way axis of left v right, authoritarian v libertarian is incredibly shallow.
     my reason for the constant usage is largely because i understand communicating these ideas without a shorthand or something 
     easily identifiable or relatable would only complicate the message more. it is a necessary evil.</p>

<p>i have many friends who, for lack of a better term, aren't politically engaged. i don't mean they don't protest or they 
    don't go out of their way to post infographics on instagram, but more that up until now, haven't had a reason to 
    think or even care that much about political issues. many of these people probably fit into a centre-left category. 
    they aren't racist, homophobic, sexist or transphobic, at least not in pure intention. the fact this is now considered 
    'left' is a bit hard to stomach. they've probably never interrogated the base assumptions and values they have, and the 
    sometimes deeper implications of some of those things, but they wouldn't tolerate any of the more harmful ideologies. 
    the best way to describe these people is, they don't actively care about anything going on, usually because they don't see 
    a need to. we have all been this person at some point, but for most of us, we came to a point where we actively formed an 
    opinion on an issue, usually because it presented in our life, and wether we knew it or not, it was a political statement.</p>

<p>for me, that happened very early on. i am disabled. i have what is known as cerebral palsy (ataxia diplegia for those 
    particularly interested), and while it was something i accepted without question and never felt shame over, i was aware 
    that i was treated differently. even as a five-year-old, i knew it was wrong, ironically because i also did not understand why 
    it was happening. when i made friends with kids from a variety of cultural backgrounds and saw how some people also treated 
    them as outsiders. when i hung around girls, i didn't like how a boy who liked one of them could decide 'we are getting married', 
    and then hold a makeshift ceremony on the cricket pitch without any input from the 'bride' who was at the very least, 
    uncomfortable. when i went into highschool and met openly queer people, i saw how segmented they were from the rest of the 
    school. a lot of my beliefs were just the offshoot normalisation, but more than anything it was empathy with those who were 
    otherised, that i saw people experience the same targeting i received, and i knew it was not okay. over time, i saw how these 
    basic issues became politicised, how they didn't fit in a vacuum. i came to terms very quickly with how my beliefs in fairness 
    were not shared universally, and how that affected people in very real capacities. i saw name calling and a general sense of 
    ostracisation become a hatred, a denial of existence.</p>

<p>i had a stint where i was consuming anti-sjw content when i was around 15, peak gamergate. at the time, i didn't see how 
    incompatible it was to my core beliefs until i saw how my algorithm started suggesting content from figures further, and 
    more openly right leaning, then what i was exposing myself to. the connections became more apparent when i saw how people 
    who were advocating for 'common sense' and swore up and down they weren’t racist, align themselves with those who, at the 
    very least, you could tell were somewhat 'okay' with it. the more 'centrist' takes sounded more and more like the extreme ones, 
    and before i knew it, the veil had seemingly dropped. sure, i still saw a lot of behaviours from the left i either didn't 
    understand or sometimes thought were unreasonable (and shit, i still see a lot of that let's be fair), but the backlash and 
    its talking points all seemed to be designed to be set up for pushing people further to the right. i saw it naked. i saw 
    the alt-right pipeline. it also helped that around the same time i saw content from people whose values more closely aligned
     with my own. it also helped they were profoundly less annoying in delivery (except for hassan. fuck hassan. i fucking hate that 
     abrasive cunt.)</p>

<p>i outline my experience to introduce a concept that i'm sure has come up in discussion countless times. this was my left-pipeline.</p>

<p>when we think of political pipelines, we tend to fixate on the alt-right pipeline. in case you haven't seen it, i highly recommend 
    you watch 'how to radicalise a normie', by innuendo studios. but if you're new, the alt-right pipeline is the path one takes 
    between political apathy to right-wing extremist. it looks different for everyone, but consider how someone who may partake in 
    edgy humour may gradually shift into communities where the line between racial humour and genuinely harmful opinions on race is 
    blurred, almost indistinguishable. one might start to tolerate certain opinions that up until now have been considered ironic, 
    and soon you're finding yourself in more and more radical circles. eventually the pretext of humor is dropped. you might think 
    this is just all a coincidence, but that's the trick you see. the alt-right pipeline is designed so the shift in politics feels 
    so incremental, gradual and impersonal that every step further feels insubstantial. in psychology, we call this gradual escalation,
     sunk-cost fallacy or irrational escalation of commitment. this is intentional. and it is a form of grooming. it cannot be 
     stated enough that this pipeline is all manufactured, and has knowing facilitators at every step of the way. it is designed 
     to work best when the possibility of becoming a facist seems ridiculous and hyperbolic.</p>

<p>*sigh*</p>

<p>the fact of the matter is, as much as we on the left understand this tactic, we have continually failed miserably to do 
    anything substantial. the left is really good at identifying the endpoints of this journey: nazism, facism, white supremacy, 
    eugenics, and can often enough pick the starting points: the signalling of 'common sense', anti-woke conversations, a 
    resistance to diverse representation in media. the problem comes that we are very bad at spotting the middle, sorting 
    the facilitators from those being facilitated and distinguishing exactly where someone is on their journey, which 
    manifests as a failure to act accordingly. worse yet, we often tend to see someone further along then they are, usually 
    because our sense of scale is warped due to only seeing the inevitable results of where that road ends. we tend to either 
    speak bluntly, tell people behaviour is outright unacceptable, which skips over the groundwork and base assumptions as to 
    why that is, making criticism seem hostile, or we gesture to the end of the pipeline, something the right has specifically 
    designed to seem alarmist. outside resistance only acts as a doubling of faith.</p>

    <p>i was having a conversation with a friend around wording in a formal document that mentioned queer members of a club. 
        they were concerned about how to word it in such a way that addressed both transgender and non-binary individuals, 
        which queer could ostensibly do, if there was a more formal variant to use. naturally, i suggested gender-diverse, 
        to which they countered that the term would only technically address non-binary individuals, because a good deal of 
        trans people still inhabit the gender binary, they’ve just gone from a 1 to a 0. after this, a discussion ensued of 
        finding the correct terminology, which if i remember consisted of ‘transgender and gender diverse’, as the output. as 
        good as that conversation was, the thought hit me that this conversation was only possible because this friend and i 
        both had that understanding of gender, the separation of sex, an understanding of what non-binary means, and the definitions 
        of ‘queer’, ‘transgender’ and ‘genderqueer’. if i was in any other position, or only understood non-binary people as ‘the 
    third gender’, i would’ve bounced off of the conversation just like that.</p>

    <p>a similar thing happened later that week, where my mum and i were talking about gender affirming care being added to 
        medicare, and the topic of non-binary people came up. my mum, a nurse, started to talk about how being non-binary was 
        influenced by a genetic factor, something about a certain protein shifting from the ear to the pinky finger prenatal. 
        i had no idea what she was talking about. i tried to refute it, and tried to defend non-binary existence. it wasn’t until 
        about 5 minutes in, that i started to hastily recite the talk of gender being separate to sex, but at that point, it was 
        too late. i entered the conversation emotionally charged and confrontational, it set up the rest of the chat. my mum for 
        context would probably fit into a subsection of ‘moderates’ that have noticeably progressed since early adulthood, but 
        have found it hard to keep up, and believe that they have already made enough concessions to solidify themselves as 
        allies to the many social causes; that too much has been asked of them when we present the idea that the world is still 
        changing.</p>

<p>ihis anxiety that the world is changing too fast is probably the biggest factor in a lot of roughly progressive gen x and 
    boomers shifting to the right. back in 2016, when conservatism was beginning to pick up steam online, the political divide 
    we were living in reached a point of criticality. saying you were going to vote for trump was a death sentence. concede any 
    reasonable point he may have made (a single-hand count) and people would dogpile onto you, hastily applying the labels of 
    racist, sexist, homophobic, the list goes on for agreeing with a man, who make no mistake, is all those things. the alt-right 
    at the time had compiled a list of arguments or issues one could discuss to incite reactions and drive wedges, which the left 
    handily fell for every single fucking time. bringing up transgender people in sports, long used as a dog whistle to rally 
    transphobic sentiment, and suddenly having questions around trans women competing in powerlifting labelled you as transphobic. 
    mention how a black person gunned down by the police was in fact pointing a gun at the officers that shot him, you’re now a 
    racist. the way this works is usually, as a conservative, you bring up a topic that has, or at least seems to have a level of 
    nuance. make your case, usually one that is oppositional to the left’s stance, some people not informed to the nuance at play 
    or unaware that you’re not bringing it up to ‘’ask questions’ actually ‘ask questions’, watch as the people who are either more 
    informed on your actual stance, or more likely, more defensive and stupidly reactive call foul, a wedge is created. yes, a 
    person of colour holding a gun towards police is going to usually be shot. you could make the argument that colour is a relevant 
    factor (and i would absolutely agree), but those looking at the pure facts of the incident are going to say ‘of course he got shot, 
    he was pointing a gun’, and suddenly they’re called racist for not having the same base assumptions and understandings on race 
    and the many privileges it affords a white person. this person knew no better, chances are. and now they have been called a 
    racist. and people take offense to that. this is one of the key tactics of courting regular people into conservative circles. 
    you alienate them from the outside, and make them feel like you’re both working on ‘common sense’. make no mistake. i seriously 
    believe this was one of the biggest factors in trump’s first presidency.</p>

<p>i understand the anxiety that appealing to the majority, the straight, cis, white demographic is demeaning. i just simply 
    come from the perspective that the support of a majority is statistically and socially invaluable. aside from pure numbers, 
    it’s been observed that authoritarians require the belief that oppression is acceptable in order to act upon it. it only makes 
    sense that someone like that would want to live in a fantasy in which they are ‘authorised’ to oppress. ironic, huh. this is 
    why those drunk white people you see on the tram at 3 in the afternoon always finish their racist tirade with ‘i’m just saying 
    what we’re all thinking’. it’s a thought terminating cliche that allows one to believe that society at large agrees with them, 
    that their behaviour is acceptable, without having to actually read the room to check if that’s on jah or cap. more 
    systematically, this is ‘the silent majority’ or ‘silent australia’. nothing takes the wind out of the sails faster for an 
    authoritarian than to be confronted with the idea that their worldview is not acceptable in the eyes of society. you don’t 
    need to change the mind of everyone, just enough people that those who are most concerned with staying the majority, have to 
    switch sides (or at least pretend to) to be that majority.</p>

<p>things to remember when engaging in conversation:</p>

<li>you do not need to tolerate harassment. there is a stark difference between someone who might hold outdated views or 
    red-flaggish opinions on race, and someone who is using slurs, will not listen to a person of colour, or views a certain 
    race as ‘backwards’. it’s the difference between saying immigrants are taking all the jobs, and that they are rapists and 
    thieves. one speaks to an economic narrative which can be disproven, the other to a moral failing that is immutable. similarly, 
    you are under no obligation to allow transphobes into queer spaces. of course, exposure to the other is always valuable, and 
    there will probably be a time where you may need to involve someone in a space to create a sense of solidarity, but that can 
    only happen with a lot of preparation and acceptance from both parties. as hard as this all is, it should not reach a point 
    where your mental health is taking a nosedive. the point of any conversation should be to question and ultimately dismantle 
    the dog whistles, so a person is forced to consider and reconcile their underlying argument, not allow a conservative free 
    access to vulnerable people. you also don’t ‘owe’ anybody these conversations. </li>
    <br>
<li>meet people where they are at, or at least pretend to. what i mean by this is understand any concept you bring up is going to 
    need groundwork laid. if i’m trying to have a conversation about non-binary people, i need to explain in very basic terms what 
    the separation of gender and sex means. i’m not going to describe bisexuality as ‘the attraction to 2 genders’ i’m going to 
    say it’s when a person ‘swings both ways’, because that first description requires a person to accept there are more than 2 
    genders. are they in the position to be receptive to what you’re telling them based off what they already accept about the world? 
    the more you try to impose on a person in a single sitting without progression, the more you come off like vomiting word salad and 
    more radical than you actually are.</li>
<br>
<li>don’t be afraid to call out disingenuous arguments. if someone was to ask me about transgender minors receiving gender 
    affirming care, they might gesture to ‘studies say blockers are dangerous’. it’s tempting to come back with a study that 
    says they aren’t. personally, i’d rather come back to say ‘yes, there are risks associated with puberty blockers. however, 
    use of them needs to be signed off by a medical professional with informed consent. besides the point however, people make 
    personal medical decisions every day that carry risks associated, and i personally think a human being has the right to make 
    those decisions for themselves. the fact they carry risks does not change that core belief i hold. i don’t see how puberty 
    blockers are different from say, plastic surgery, tattoos, or piercings in this regard’. suddenly, the conversation isn’t 
    about trying to prove and disprove each other, rather making someone think about what their actual desired policy would be, 
    and if that correlates with their value of freedom. it allows the conversation to progress to the root of the issue.</li>
    <br>
<li>think of the incentive sets before you enter. is the person a friend of yours? do you have any power or social status over
     them? do they fundamentally have a reason to respect you from their perspective? if you answered no to all of these questions,
      you are a stranger on the internet. and when was the last time your opinion changed because a random showed up on your twitter 
      threads? also consider their incentive to stay. they might have friends they fear ostracising, they might have spent the last 
      decade spouting the same beliefs and feel shame, or they financially gain off of their beliefs. any of these can be barriers 
      for a person to change their mind, especially, that last one. trying to have honest conversations with conservative debate-bros
       or grifters is a waste of time. lastly, consider what you ask of them. the goal of your conversation is a shift in opinion, 
       even if only slightly, their goal is to remain where they are. by nature of the conversation, it is an uphill battle where 
       you need to establish a reason to listen to you. also, let’s be blunt. being (or being able to pretend you are) straight, 
       while, cis, masculine helps.</li>
       <br>
<li>we like to think that every conversation can end on a satisfying note. a changed opinion. but if you look at how a person has 
    first arrived at radical opinions, it was a series of interactions, potentially in the hundreds. the process of moving back is 
    similarly arduous. you need to be comfortable with doing thankless work. attempting to force someone in your direction is 
    ultimately harmful, and it tends to create adversarial reactions once they realise your intentions, and will look at them 
    uncharitably, like they have been trained to.</li>
    <br>
<li>we live under democratic capitalism. the left tends to think democratically (what is fair), right wingers tend to think like a 
    capitalist (what is deserved). under this framing, a lot of your arguments may ring hollow, because your base assumption about 
    what is right is different. by giving more funding to poor communities for example, you’re upsetting the natural state of 
    capitalism and the hierarchy. it might create equality, but it’s only fair if your framework is based on the idea that everyone 
    deserves opportunity, and not that such things need to be fought for and bought with purchasing power. it’s an advantage that is 
    given on no merit that capitalism values.if anything, a capitalist would look at charity to the poor as giving money to those 
    who obviously don’t know how to handle it properly like rich people, and of little weight in creating market value. naturally, 
    people won’t say this outloud, they’ll look for proxy arguments to defend the outcome. most things decried as unjust by the 
    right can usually be traced to someone moving to the ‘wrong’ part of the natural order of hierarchy. cue my jordan peterson 
    impression and lobsters. you will need to acknowledge and explain this framework more often than not.</li>
    <br>
<li>you *will* need to be educated on what you talk about. quite frankly, as many buzzwords as i’m cramming in here, i do not 
    consider myself adequately educated on any one issue to talk about it in full. hypocrite that i am. i have so, so many lgbtqi+ 
    friends in my life, and i can defend against most of the basic points spouted by grifters, but i am not the right person to 
    talk about these things. i don’t understand policy, i haven’t had any lived experience, i don’t have quick and fact-checked 
    defenses ready for ‘transgender as a mental illness’ or the debate around minors getting access to gender-affirming care. 
    i don’t think it’s a mental illness. i think minors should have access to puberty blockers at the least under medical supervision, 
    but if you were to pick my brain around why i think those things, or the extrapolation of those issues, i’d probably fall 
    apart a little bit. writing that now, i feel like i should fix that. people will poke holes in your argument, if you’re not 
    adequately prepared with facts and how people will respond to them, you’re open for ridicule.</li>
    <br>
<li>lastly, there are undeniable ops. grifters, people with 88 plastered on their tl, people who genuinely are too far gone. you 
    have my permission to be belligerent, be performative, emasculate, but only in doses. people will see how you ‘treat those you 
    disagree with’ and believe that this is how the left is, that no one is welcome to change, that given the opportunity, liberals 
    will have no qualm hurling the most vicious insults. you need to make clear it’s not because you ‘disagree’ with them, it’s that 
    they are wrong, being dishonest, lying, disingenuous. people for better or for worse do respond to public spats. by all means, 
    call nick fuentes for the virgin he is. capitalize off moments of weakness and breaks of character. it might not mean much to us, 
    but the appearance of ‘weakness’ is poison to them.</li>

<p>this post is in two parts. the second is already up, but please. take a breather. look at some dogs. it’s a hike, but so far,  
    i’m glad you’re with me on this adventure. please let me know what you think!
