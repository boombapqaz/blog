<li> why did you make this site?</li>
<p>idk. i guess i thought having a corner of the net would be nice. i ran a 'blog' before on carrd.co, i found it quite limiting,
    and with no way to effectively archive material, i felt like i couldn't just post whatever. everything had to be meaningful. i like it here more
</p>
<li>why is everything lowercase?</li>
<p>im pretentious. blogs are written normally partially because i dont care enough to go back through them to edit, and 
    i feel like the capitalisations make it easier to read the bigger chunks of text.
</p>
<li>how did you do this?</li>
<p>i got a <a href="neocities.org">neocities account</a>, used <a href="https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities">this</a>
 to automatically deploy my code from github to neocities, and followed <a href="https://flamedfury.com/guides/11ty-homepage-neocities/">this</a>
guide. i'm really not a programmer though, hence why everything is so bare.</p>
<li>you said you make music, can you teach me?</li>
<p>i'm actually working on a series right now dedicated to learning ableton, start to finish. i feel like a lot of the resources out
    there are trash.
</p>
<li>why is this website's aesthetic all over the place?</li>
<p>partially because i'm not a programmer, so i'm naturally inept, but also because i struggle to settle on artistic cohesion in all
that i do.</p>
